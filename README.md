# anchor-ci

This is the repo for the anchor CI action, allowing users to plugin the action to 
any Anchor(Solana) repo and let it take care of everything from setting up the Solana toolchain the local, to
setting up the local validator, build process, and running the testsuite. 

This will help foster an easier way for devs to create CI systems
for their anchor project more easily.

Will be releasing the first v0.1 beta version in a couple of days.
Feel free to open issues and send in product requests as this is 
still the the first beta version, so expecting a lot
of improvements, will try my best to assist you the best I can.

Thanks, everybody for taking the time to read through this
and let's BUILD
